# 📦 Shipment Data Analytics: Cleaning, Exploration & Trend Analysis

This project explores global shipment data to extract insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling. The notebook uses interactive visualizations and regression techniques to understand product logistics and cost dynamics.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Course**: IE6600 Computation and Visualization for Analytics  
- **Semester**: Spring 2025  
- **Instructor**: Prof. Sivarit Sultornsanee  
- **Team Members**:
  - Stephy Romichan
  - Gagan Yadav
  - Meghana Rao  

## 📦 Dataset

- **Content**: Shipment records including country, product group, shipment mode, weight, unit price, freight cost, pack price, and brand information.
- **Goal**: Clean the dataset, explore key features, and derive meaningful visual insights about shipment trends and costs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Handle missing values and anomalies
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize shipment metrics across geography and time
- Analyze correlations between product features and cost factors
- Evaluate predictive models using RMSE

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- `scikit-learn` for regression modeling

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Pie chart for shipment modes
- Top 10 countries by shipment volume
- Bar chart of product groups
- Histogram of shipment weights
- Time-series trends in shipment value
- Heatmap, box plots, and pair plots for feature relationships

## 📈 Advanced Analysis

- Correlation analysis between unit price, weight, and freight cost
- Linear regression and RMSE interpretation in context

## 🧪 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shipment-data-analysis.git
   cd shipment-data-analysis
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Project 1_CVA_Group-2.ipynb"
   ```

## 📍 Future Enhancements

- Predictive modeling for freight cost estimation
- Dashboard visualization for logistics monitoring
- Integration with live supply chain data sources
